# cypress-basico-v2

A course project based for end-to-end testing learning purposes.

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions `v18.15.0` and `9.6.4` of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the test in headless mode.

Or, run `npm run cy:open` to open Cypress in interactive mode.
